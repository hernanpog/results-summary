### Useful resources

These are the resources that I used to learn and practice the skills required for this project.
- [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro by SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=PLEPye7A7EcQZrT3VSBb7jtxnxIfY3yyG6&index=1&pp=iAQB)
  Amazing free course on Youtube that teaches about foundational HMTL and CSS plus NLT (Nested Layouts Technique) and a little bit of Media Queries. 100% percent recommended.
- [Kevin Powell (The King of CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)
  His videos are always useful when you don't fully understand some concepts or you want to go the extra mile in a specific area of CSS. Subscription to his channel is a MUST!
- [https://www.w3schools.com/]
  I know some people prefer MDN documentation (which is also really good) but I prefer W3Schools. I find it to be so much easier to navigate through website.
